# CUBirdSightings 

Explore recent sightings of rare northeastern birds reported by the birdwatching community using the eBird API. Discover bird locations on an interactive map and get directions to each sighting.

Integrates eBird API with Google Maps API to provide an up-to-date map of rare bird sightings near Cornell. Also allows user to get directions to the sighting. Uses HTML, CSS, JS.

This project was rewarding for me as it taught me a lot about how to integrate public APIs. The project still needs work on scaling when it is not full screen. I also had to remove the API keys from the public code for privacy reasons, hopefully will be able to hide them as environment variables soon. Pictures of the website working are attached.
